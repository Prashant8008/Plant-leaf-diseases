# Plant Disease Detection Project 🌱

A streamlined project for detecting plant diseases using a trained deep learning model. This tool is lightweight, easy to use, and configurable for various plant disease datasets.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Pre-Trained Model:** Quickly predict diseases without retraining.
- **Simple Configuration:** Modify settings via `config.json`.
- **Lightweight Design:** Minimal file structure for ease of deployment.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.8+
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** TensorFlow, Flask (if app-based), NumPy, OpenCV
- **Tools:** Virtual Environment (venv)
